## Running the application

### Setup

To run the application locally, you'll first need a Wolfram Alpha Api key. Get yours [here](https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/).

Once you have an api key, clone this repo:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshrabiu/Omnus.git
```  

cd into the project directory
```sh
cd Omnus
```


And create a `config.js` file in the root directory of the application. Paste your api key inside of the file like so:
```js
module.exports = {apiKey: 'yourApiKey'}
```

Then refer to the following sections:

### Running With Docker


Build the Docker image using the local dockerfile
```sh
docker build -t joshrabiu/omnus .
```

Then, run the following commands, replacing PORT_NUMBER with the port you want the application to run on locally:

```sh
docker run -p $PORT_NUMBER:8000 joshrabiu/omnus
```

For regular Docker users, the app will be running on
```sh
localhost:$PORT_NUMBER
```

For Docker Machine users, it will run on 
```sh
$DOCKER_IP:$PORT_NUMBER
``` 

To find your Docker Macine IP, run this command: 
```sh
docker machine ip
```

### Running Without Docker


Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Then start the Express Server:

```sh
yarn start
```

Then, open a new terminal tab/window in the same directory and `cd` to the react subfolder like so:

```sh
cd client
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Then start the react app:

```sh
yarn start
```

## Running Tests
Omnus's test suite is composed of Selenium Webdriver, Mocha, Chai and SuperTest and includes both Integration/e2e testing and unit tests.

Tests are run with the following command:

```sh
mocha
```

Which should output the following, given that everything works:
